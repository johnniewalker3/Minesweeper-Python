# Minesweeper-Python
A simple version of the game minesweeper.Board width and board height are considered equal so we pass only one parameter that expresses the dimension of the board.Also,
we pass and the number of bombs the grid has.When you run the game it will display in the screen a 10*10 board (row=0-9,col=0-9) and you have to give every time the row and the column of the board.(row->0-9,col->0-9).It's a console game.Feel free to take the code if you want to build something similar.
